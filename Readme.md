 Tasks:
- 
- The "hide" button hides and shows the list of tasks, additionally the button text changes according to its status.
  
- The tasks have four options, go up, go down, done and delete.
  
- The "New task" button must add a new task as the last item in the list. The entry "New task" must reset its content when adding a new task.
